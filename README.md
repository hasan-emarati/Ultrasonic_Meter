This project is a DIY ultrasonic distance meter implemented using the SRF05 ultrasonic module and the ATmega16 microcontroller. It enables distance measurements in centimeters and meters and displays the results on an LCD screen.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the main code (`main.c`) written for the ATmega16 microcontroller. Additionally, you will need to include specific header files (`alcd.h` and `delay.h`) for successful compilation. These header files are necessary for LCD control and timing functions.

### Getting Started
__________________________________________________________
Follow these steps to use the Ultrasonic Distance Meter:

1. **Circuit Connection**: Connect the SRF05 module to the ATmega16 microcontroller and the LCD display. Make sure to establish the connections based on the corresponding pins and connectors.

2. **Library Installation**: Obtain the required header files (`alcd.h` and `delay.h`) from a suitable source. Add these header files to your project for successful compilation.

3. **Compilation**: Compile the project code using a suitable compiler for the ATmega16 microcontroller.

4. **Upload to ATmega16**: Upload the compiled binary to the ATmega16 microcontroller using a suitable programmer.

5. **Running the Ultrasonic Distance Meter**: Power on the microcontroller, and the ultrasonic meter will start functioning. It will measure distances and display the results on the connected LCD screen.
